# G.I.D.D.Y

## Graphically Intelligent Distribution DisplaY


GIDDY is an application that will display the distribution of data inputed into the system in addition to providing other **statistical analysis tools** such as:
- Determining the appropriate plot type
- Outputting summary statistics
- Providing data for predictive analysis

GIDDY's target audience is for statisticians who require fast, basic analysis of their data. This streamlines their workflow by switftly providing summarized statistics in a few keystrokes rather than manually doing the process through a calculator or languages such as R.

I chose to pursue this project as a statistics student who feels that obtaining basic information such as this is a trivial task that only hinders performance. Although not revolutionary, this may have a slight advantage in terms of speed in comparison to R studio, jupyter notebooks, or other similar programs.

## User Story
- As a user, I want to be able to find summary statistics for 2 quantitative variables (means, standard deviations, etc)
- As a user, I want to be able to find summary statistics for a quantitative variable and a categorical variable (median, quartiles, etc)
- As a user, I want to be able to know what plot is the best for my data
- As a user, I want to be able to predict data points using linear regression
- As a user, I want to be able to have n categories in my dataset and find summary statistics for each of them
- As a user, I want to be able to read a preexisting dataset from file
- As a user, I want to be able to read a preexisting dataset to file
