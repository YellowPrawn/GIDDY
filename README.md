# G.I.D.D.Y

## Graphically Intelligent Distribution DisplaY


GIDDY is an application that will display the distribution of data inputed into the system in addition to providing other **statistical analysis tools** such as:
- Determining the appropriate plot type
- Outputting summary statistics
- Providing data for predictive analysis

GIDDY's target audience is for statisticians who require fast, basic analysis of their data. This streamlines their workflow by switftly providing summarized statistics in a few keystrokes rather than manually doing the process through a calculator or languages such as R.

I chose to pursue this project as a statistics student who feels that obtaining basic information such as this is a trivial task that only hinders performance. Although not revolutionary, this may have a slight advantage in terms of speed in comparison to R studio, jupyter notebooks, or other similar programs.
